# Crowdfunding_ETL

This project contains four mini projects and has been done in collaboration with Nancy Gomez, Leah Apking, and Erin Clark. The project is designed to provide practice in building an ETL pipeline using Python, Pandas, and either Python dictionary methods or regular expressions to extract and transform the data. 

The project has been divided into four mini-projects:

 - Create the Category and Subcategory DataFrames
 - Create the Campaign DataFrame
 - Create the Contacts DataFrame
 - Create the Crowd Funding Database
